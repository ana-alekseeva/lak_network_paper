# Learn From Your First Course Mate? The Impact of Joint Course Enrollments on Student Performance and Major Choice

This study investigates first-year co-enrollment networks and their effect on the final college GPA and major switching. This study uses data from one cohort of students in a large public research university in the U.S. (N = 4,661) and applies a novel method of incorporating student co-enrollment network characteristics based on the nearest 2, 4, 8, and 16 neighbors.

# Prerequisites

Python and R must be installed to reproduce the results of the study. Unfortunately, we cannot share the data that were used in the analysis.

# Project structure

## Data Preprocessing

There are three Jupyter Notebooks 01. preprocessing, 02. network_variables, 03. KNN_variables_prep that were used for initial preprocessing, search for k-nearest neighbors, and computing aggregated metrics correspondingly.

## Analysis

05. first_year_regression R script runs three specifications of fixed effects regression for final GPA and one specification of logistic regression for major change.
